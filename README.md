# Musical Statues

Welcome to Musical Statues! ðŸŽ¶ This Python program, powered by the Spotify API,
adds a twist to your music enjoyment. The songs play seamlessly,
but watch out â€“ when the music stops and it says "Don't Move," any detected movement on the camera means you lose the game!

# How it works
1. The program seamlessly integrates with the Spotify API to play your favorite songs. Ensure you have your Spotify credentials ready for authentication.
2. While vibing to the tunes, be prepared for unexpected pauses. The music will stop randomly, adding an element of surprise to the game.
3. When the program instructs "Don't Move," the camera actively scans for any movement. If the camera detects movement during this period, you lose the game! The program will close the window, bringing your fun session to an end.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Spotify Developer Account (for API credentials)
- Webcam (for movement detection)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/musical-statues.git```
2. Set up Spotify API credentials:
   - Create a Spotify Developer Account
   - Generate a new application to obtain the client ID and client secret.
   - Add your credentials to the ```musicalstatues.py``` file.

# After the game
After each game session, a recording of your Musical Statues experience will be available in the same folder as the program.
